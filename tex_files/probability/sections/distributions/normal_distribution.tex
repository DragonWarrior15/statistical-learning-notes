    \section{Normal Distribution}
    The Normal distribution (or gaussian distribution) is defined between $-\inf$ and $\inf$. It is parametrized by mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$, $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^{2})$
    \begin{align*}
        f_{X}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^{2}}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}}
    \end{align*}
    As already described,
    \begin{align*}
        E[X] &= \mu\\
        Var(X) &= \sigma^{2}
    \end{align*}

    A \emph{Standard Normal} is defined as a normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma^{2} = 1$\\
    Any normal distribution can be converted to a standard normal as $X = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$\\
    If $Y = aX + b$, then $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(a \mu + b, a^{2}\sigma^{2})$.\newline

    For a standard normal variable $Z$, it is standard to denote
    \begin{align*}
        P(Z \leq z) = \Phi(z) \quad P(Z = z) = \phi(z) = \mathcal{N}(0,1)
    \end{align*}

    \subsection{Multivariate Normal Distribution}
    Multivariate normal distribution is an extension of a normal distribution into multiple dimensions
    \begin{align*}
        f_{\mathbf{X}}(\bm{x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{d} \lvert \Sigma \rvert}} exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x} - \bm{\mu})\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{x} - \bm{\mu})^{T})
    \end{align*}
    for $d$ dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$ with mean vector $\bm{\mu}$ and covriance matrix $\Sigma$.
