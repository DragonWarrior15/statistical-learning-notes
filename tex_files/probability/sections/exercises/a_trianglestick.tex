        Assume that we break the stick at points $X$ and $Y$. Assume $X < Y$. Then for the stick to form a triangle, the three lengths $X, Y-X$ and $1-Y$ should satisfy the following three inequalities
        \begin{align*}
            X+(Y-X) &> 1-Y\\
            (Y-X) + (1-Y) &> X\\
            X + (1-Y) &> Y-X
        \end{align*}
        which is nothing but the triangluar region between the points $(0, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5)$ and $(0.5, 1)$ and has the area of $1/8$. We should also consider the case $Y < X$ and by symmetry, the area is same. Now, $X$ and $Y$ comprise of the entire square region $X \leq 1$ and $Y \leq 1$. Hence the required probability is $2 * 1/8 = 1/4$.
