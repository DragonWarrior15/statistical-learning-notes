## Basis Function

Basis function is the generalized form of the above two approaches. Basis are functions on $X$ that transform it. Thus, when doing regression with basis functions, we simply regress $y$ with a family of transformations of $x$.

For polynomial regression, the basis are powers of $x$ and for step function, the basis are constant values in different ranges.
