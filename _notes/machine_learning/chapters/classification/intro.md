# Classification

For more than two classes, it is hard to maintain the ordering between them using linear regression. For two classes however, linear regression can be used to prepare an ordering of the data (although difficult to interpret as probability themselves).

**Classification using linear regression to predict binary reponse will be same as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).**
