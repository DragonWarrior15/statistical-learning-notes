## Recurring and Transient States

A state $i$ is called *recurrent* if, starting from $i$, and travelling anywhere, it is always possible to return to $i$. If a state is not recurrent, it is *transient*. States in a recurrent class are periodic if they can be grouped into $d > 1$ groups so that all transitions from one group lead to the next group.
