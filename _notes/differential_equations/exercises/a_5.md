Using [Euler-Cauchy equation]({{ "/notes/differential_equations/order_two_linear.html#euler-cauchy-equations" | relative_url }}), we know that $x^{m}$ is a solution. Substituiting and taking out the common factor $x^{m}$,
\begin{align}
    m^{2} - 4m + 4 &= 0\newline
    \implies m &= 2
\end{align}

Since this is the case of double root, the general solution is
\begin{align}
    y = \roundbr{c_{1} + c_{2}\ln x}x^{2}
\end{align}
